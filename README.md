Week 3 team assignment

### Christian
I like to use computers and have been using them alomst my entire life. My dad was a large influence for this in my life. He started me on a Macintosh II
my interest and curiousity took me ever since. Now I'm going to school to study computer science to hopefully do something intersting.
